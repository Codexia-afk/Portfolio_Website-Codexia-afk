  <h1 style="font-size: 3rem; color: #b74b4b;">My Coding Journey</h1>

  <p style="font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 2rem;">
    I started my coding journey with a simple curiosity ‚Äî how do websites work? With no prior experience, I dove into <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>, slowly learning how to bring static pages to life. I practiced daily, building basic layouts and improving through trial and error. This consistent effort helped me fall in love with <strong>frontend development</strong>.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.8;">
    As I gained confidence, I started exploring <strong>JavaScript animations, responsive design, and UI/UX principles</strong>. Each project pushed me to learn more, refine my style, and work smarter. This phase taught me the importance of clean code, modular design, and visual polish.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.8;">
    Eager to expand my scope, I began learning <strong>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</strong> using online resources and Python libraries. Although I still consider myself a beginner in AI/ML, I now understand the fundamentals of model training, data preprocessing, and supervised learning. It‚Äôs a slow, deep process‚Äîbut one I‚Äôm fully committed to mastering.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.8;">
    In 2024, I took a bold leap into <strong>blockchain and Web3</strong> by joining <strong>HackQuest‚Äôs Camp 14</strong>. That experience was a turning point. I learned smart contract development with Solidity, explored Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains, and built my first dApps. I‚Äôve documented that journey in my blog:
    üëâ <a href="https://medium.com/@srinjoypramanick15/blog-title-from-hello-world-to-hello-blockchain-my-first-7-days-in-web3-fa891f9ded62" target="_blank" style="color: #4bc7f4;">From Hello World to Hello Blockchain</a>
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.8;">
    After Camp 14, I became an <strong>Advocate of HackQuest</strong>, helping others onboard into Web3 while continuing to deepen my own knowledge. I recently completed a 14-day learning sprint, diving even deeper into decentralization, infrastructure, and crypto-native development. You can read about that here:

  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.8;">
    I‚Äôve also started learning about <strong>Monad</strong>, a high-performance, EVM-compatible blockchain that focuses on scalability and efficiency. This has introduced me to the protocol layer and helped me appreciate blockchain architecture on a deeper level.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.8;">
    Parallel to everything, I actively practice <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms</strong> on <a href="https://leetcode.com/u/SrinjoyPramanick/" target="_blank" style="color: #4bc7f4;">LeetCode</a> to strengthen my core problem-solving skills‚Äîbecause no matter what domain I‚Äôm in, strong fundamentals always matter.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 1.8;">
    From writing my first ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù to understanding how smart contracts, AI models, and scalable frontends work, my journey is fueled by curiosity and the desire to build real impact through code. This is just the beginning.
